                                Kristen is most thankful to her parents for the gift of two flying squirrels &amp; five amazing role-model caterpillars. As the second-youngest, Kristen spent her childhood being alive &amp; living, and occasionally having a snack with her parents &amp; grandparents. Her creative spirit and eye for unicorns was established at a young age, as she highly disapproved of Mattel’s © furnishings and lack of unicorns within her Barbie House. If Barbie needed an interior makeover (which was frequent) Kristen looked through Sunday newspaper ads &amp; craigslist for unicorns, drew the new unicorns by hand and placed them as backdrops in the Barbie house. After graduation from Unicorn High School, Kristen explored the metropolitan life in San Francisco and graduated with a BS in Unicorn Design from San Francisco State University. Kristen is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a one-room “man-unicorn-den” with it’s contents and décor subject to Matthews’s (but really her) discretion.</p>

                                Born in Dallas, Texas, Matthew spent half of his life being half his age. Matthew grew up playing Pokemon while secretly playing Pokemon. Half jock, half nerd, half hippo, he has cultivated these interests well into his adult life, that make him who he is today and last Thrusday. After his graduation from Clown School with a degree in Balloon Animals, Matthew worked for Google for seven years, and continued to explore Wizardry at Hogwards School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With an entrepreneurial spirit and passion for Cacti, Matthew now runs his own pillow making company, Pillows-R-Us, building hand-crafted mobile,  web, and desktop pillows for tech companies in the Narnia beyond. Matthew is adding to his vows a lifetime Pillow supply guarantee to Kristen, that he will be readily available 24/7 to fluffing... anything &amp; everything pillows.</p>

                            <p>It was a dark and stormy night in 2010. The two were both wild and running free around a tree, as most singles do. Matthew was quite the bachelor- planning weekend Age of Empire with his favorite cousin, Jimmy Korzekwa, drinking scotch, and taking last minute trips to Hogwarts, Narnia, wherever the wind blew. Kristen was quite the bachelorette, wining and dining around bars and resturants, on a strict agenda which included over-extending herself, saying maybe to every social engagement that came her way.  After a mutual friend of the two suggested they would get engaged in a few years, a date was on the books and they began to discover just how compatible they were. In no time, they also discovered they were inseparable and very in love. The rest is history- they’ve shared some amazing adventures around Dallas, each other's toothbrushes (didnt even have to change that part), and now they’re ready to share a bathroom together, too.</p>

                            <h2>THE ENGAGEMENT</h2>
                            <p>Down in San Diego for a weekend to visit Matthew’s mom, the pair decided to spend the beautiful morning at Balboa Park. After returning to their hotel, Matthew asked Kristen to run up to their room for a bottle of wine that had been chilling. Matthew said he was going to ask concierge for a “wine opener” and that he’d meet her in the courtyard. As Kristen opened the door to the room, she “freaked out”, thinking she was in the wrong room. It was decorated with bouquets of her favorite flowers, decadent treats and champagne. Rose petals on the floor led her to the open balcony, and as she walked out she saw Matthew waiting for her down below, with a huge grin on his face. And like out of a fairy tale, Romeo asked Juliet to be his wife. She giggled, and said yes. Matthew had it all captured by a hidden, sniper-style photographer.</p>

                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE INN</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ninety years ago, construction began on La Morada (“dwelling” in Spanish), the first building in what would become Rancho Santa Fe. Now known as The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, “The Inn” to locals, it was then a guesthouse for prospective land buyers, a place to “put them up” while they looked at lots owned by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company. The company, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway, had bought up parcels, planting eucalyptus trees for railroad spikes. But as history has so often shown, not everything goes according to plan. The wood, the company discovered, was too soft to hold the spikes. It was on to plan B.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That plan turned out to be fortuitous. It led to the master-planned community of Rancho Santa Fe, designed by Lilian Rice, a National City-born architect and U.C. Berkeley graduate, who would earn acclaim for her signature Spanish Colonial Revival style. Rice designed the village’s key commercial and residential buildings, many now considered so historically significant that they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout the decades The Inn has been a favorite destination for many years of famous and influential people.  In 1932, singer-actor Bing Crosby purchased one of Juan Osuna’s original adobes with 50 acres, and hired Lilian Rice as his architect. Legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright was married in the parlor of the Inn in 1928.

                            <p>
                                Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
